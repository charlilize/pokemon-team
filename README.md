## Notes

A challenge was setting up the router to connect all the pages; I had to refer to the lab a lot. It was also tricky creating the Create Pokemon page since I had to learn how to connect the different input types like text and a drop down menu with Supabase. Since I had images that change according to the pokemon's type, I also had  trouble with it rendering.
